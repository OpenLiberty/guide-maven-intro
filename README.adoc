NOTE: This repository contains the guide documentation source. To view the guide in published form, view it on the https://openliberty.io/guides/{projectid}.html[Open Liberty website].

Learn how to build and test a simple web application using Maven and Open Liberty.

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to configure a simple web servlet application using Maven and the Liberty 
Maven plugin. When you compile and build the application code, Maven downloads and installs 
Open Liberty. If you run the application, Maven creates an Open Liberty server and runs 
the application on it. The application displays a simple web page with a link that, when 
clicked, calls the servlet to return a simple response of `Hello! How are you today?`.

One benefit of using Maven is that, once you have defined the details of the project and 
any dependencies it has, Maven automatically handles downloading and installing any and 
all of the dependencies.

Another benefit of using Maven is that it can run automated tests on the application after 
building it. You could, of course, test your application manually by starting a server 
and pointing a web browser at the application URL. Automated tests are a much better 
approach though because Maven can easily re-run the same tests each time it builds the 
application. If the tests don't pass after you've made a change to the application, the 
build fails so you know that you need to fix your code.

You will create a Maven build definition file (`pom.xml`) for the web application project 
and use it to build the web application. You will then create a simple, automated test 
and configure Maven to run it after building the application.

== Creating a simple application

The simple web application that you will build using Maven and Open Liberty is provided 
for you in the `start` directory so that you can focus on learning about Maven. The application 
uses the standard Maven directory structure. Using the standard directory structure saves 
you from customizing the `pom.xml` file later. 

All the application source code, including the Open Liberty server configuration 
(`server.xml`), is in the `src/main/liberty/config` directory:

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
    └── src
        └── main
           └── java
           └── resources
           └── webapp
           └── liberty
                  └── config
----

== Installing Maven

Now you're ready to install Maven (if you haven't already). https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Download the binary zip or tar.gz file] 
and then follow the https://maven.apache.org/install.html[installation instructions for your operating system] 
to extract the ZIP file and add the `bin` directory (which contains the `mvn` command) 
to the `PATH` on your computer.

Test that Maven is installed by running the following command in a terminal:

[role="command"]
----
mvn -v
----

If Maven is installed properly, you should see information about the Maven installation 
similar to this:

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
Apache Maven 3.5.0 (ff8f5e7444045639af65f6095c62210b5713f426; 2017-04-03T20:39:06+01:00)

----


== Creating the project POM file

Before you can build the project, you define the Maven Project Object Model (POM) file, the `pom.xml`. 
Because the POM can look a bit daunting in full, add one section at a time.

The `pom.xml` file provided for you in the `start` directory starts with a root `<project/>` 
element and `<modelversion/>`, which is always set to `4.0.0`. The `<parent/>` section 
of the POM specifies that Maven will use the https://github.com/WASdev/ci.maven/blob/master/liberty-maven-app-parent/pom.xml[Liberty Maven parent POM] 
to build the project. This is the minimum you technically need for the POM to be valid. 
But it won't do much with this project unless you give it a bit more information about your 
application.

Now build up the rest of the `pom.xml` file, a section at a time in the space between the 
`</parent>` and `</project>` tags. Unless specified otherwise, add each of the sections 
of XML code beneath the previous one. The `</project>` tag must be the last thing in the 
`pom.xml` file.

A typical POM for a Liberty application contains the following sections:

* **Project coordinates**: The identifiers for this application.
* **Properties** ([hotspot=14-25]`<properties/>`): Any properties for the project go here, 
including compilation details and any values that are referenced during compilation of the 
Java source code and generating the application.
* **Dependencies** ([hotspot=26-65]`<dependencies/>`): Any Java dependencies that are 
required for compiling, testing, and running the application are listed here.
* **Build plugins** ([hotspot=66-136]`<build/>`): Maven is modular and each of its 
capabilities is provided by a separate plugin. This is where you specify which Maven 
plugins should be used to build this project and any configuration information needed by 
those plugins.

[role="code_command hotspot=10-13", subs="quotes"]
----
Add the project coordinates of the sample application. 
`src/pom.xml`
----

pom.xml
[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/pom.xml[tags=**]
----

The project coordinates describe the name and version of the application. The 
[hotspot=11]`artifactId` gives a name to the web application project, which is used to 
name the output files that are generated by the build (e.g. the WAR file) and the Open 
Liberty server that is created. You'll notice that other fields in the [hotspot=1-132]`pom.xml` 
file use variables that are resolved by the [hotspot=11]`artifactId` field. This is so 
that you can update the name of the sample application, including files generated by Maven, 
in a single place in the [hotspot=1-132]`pom.xml` file. The value of the [hotspot=12]`packaging` 
field is `war` so that the project output artifact is a WAR file.

[role="code_command hotspot=14-25", subs="quotes"]
----
Add the properties of the project. 
`src/pom.xml`
----

The first four properties in this section just define the encoding ([hotspot=15-16]`UTF-8`) 
and version of Java ([hotspot=17-18]`Java 8`) that Maven uses to compile the application 
source code.

The next four properties provide a single place to specify values that are used in multiple 
places throughout the application. For example, the [hotspot=20]`testServerHttpPort` value is used in 
both the server configuration (`server.xml`) file and will be used in the test class that 
you will add (`EndpointIT.java`) in the application itself. This means that you can easily 
change the port number that the server will run on without having to update the application 
code in multiple places.

The final two properties define the name and type of server package Maven uses to package 
the application with a Liberty server.

[role="code_command hotspot=26-65", subs="quotes"]
----
Add the dependencies that the web application needs in order to compile. 
`src/pom.xml`
----

The `HelloServlet.java` class depends on [hotspot=27-32]`javax.servlet-api` to compile. 
Maven will download this dependency from the Maven Central repository using the 
[hotspot=28]`groupId`, [hotspot=29]`artifactId`, and [hotspot=30]`version` details that 
you provide here. The dependency is set to [hotspot=31]`provided`, which means that the 
API is in the server runtime and doesn't need to be packaged by the application.

[role="code_command hotspot=66-131", subs="quotes"]
----
Configure the Maven plugins that build this project.
`src/pom.xml`
----

The [hotspot=66-131]`<build/>` section gives details of the two plugins that Maven uses 
to build this project.

* The Maven plugin for generating a WAR file as one of the output files.
* The Liberty Maven plugin, which gives details of the name, version, and file type of 
Open Liberty runtime package which it will download from the public Maven repository.

In the [hotspot=76-105]`liberty-maven-plugin` plugin section, the [hotspot=86]`<serverName/>` 
field defines the name of the Liberty server that Maven creates. The [hotspot=91-95]`<bootstrapProperties/>` 
section provides the set of variables that the `server.xml` references. The 
[hotspot=87]`<stripVersion/>` field removes the version number from the name of the application 
(by default the version number of the application (`1.0-SNAPSHOT`) is appended to the 
application name). This means that the application URL remains the same even when the version 
number changes.

== Testing the web application

One of the benefits of building an application with Maven is that Maven can be configured 
to run a set of tests. You can write tests for the individual units of code outside of a 
running application server (unit tests), or you can write them to call the application 
server directly (integration tests). In this example you will create a simple integration 
test that checks that the web page opens and that the correct response is returned when 
the link is clicked.

When Maven runs the test, it starts a test server, runs the application, runs the test, 
and then stops the server.

[role="code_command hotspot=10-38", subs="quotes"]
----
Create `EndpointIT` class. 
`src/test/java/io/openliberty/guides/hello/it/EndpointIT.java`  
----

EndpointIT.java
[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/src/test/java/io/openliberty/guides/hello/it/EndpointIT.java[tags=**;!copyright]
----

The test class name ends in `IT` to indicate that it contains an integration test. 
(Test classes with a name that ends in TEST are unit test classes.)

Maven is configured to run the integration test using the [hotspot=106-129 file=1]`maven-failsafe-plugin`.
The [hotspot=120-125 file=1]`<systemPropertyVariables/>` section defines some variables 
that the test class uses. The test code needs to know where to find the application that 
it is testing. While the port number and context root information can be hardcoded in the 
test class, it is better to specify it in a single place like the Maven [hotspot=1-132 file=1]`pom.xml` 
file because this information is also used by other files in the project. The 
[hotspot=120-125 file=1]`<systemPropertyVariables/>` section passes these details to the 
Java test program as a series of system properties, resolving the [hotspot=121-123 file=1]`liberty.test.port` 
and [hotspot=124 file=1]`war.name` variables.

pom.xml
[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/pom.xml[tags=**]
----

The following lines in the [hotspot=15-17 file=0]`Endpoint.java` test class uses these 
system variables to build up the URL of the application.

In the test class, after defining how to build the application URL, the [hotspot=20 file=0]`@Test` 
annotation indicates the start of the test method.

In the [hotspot=25-36 file=0]`try` block of the test method, an HTTP `GET` request to the 
URL of the application returns a status code. If the response to the request includes the 
string `Hello! How are you today?`, the test passes. If that string is not in the response, 
the test fails.  The HTTP client then disconnects from the application.

In the [hotspot=3-8 file=0]`import` statements of this test class, you'll notice that the 
test has some new dependencies. Before the test can be compiled by Maven, you need to update 
the [hotspot=1-132 file=1]`pom.xml` to include these dependencies.

The Apache [hotspot=33-38 file=1]`commons-httpclient` and [hotspot=39-44 file=1]`junit` 
dependencies are needed to compile and run the integration test [hotspot=10-38 file=0]`EndpointIT` 
class. The scope for each of the dependencies is set to [hotspot=37 file=1]`test` because 
the libraries are needed only during the Maven build and do not needed to be packaged with 
the application.

Now, during the Maven build, Maven creates the WAR file that contains the web application 
and then runs any integration test classes (classes with names that end in `IT`) that it 
finds.

The directory structure of the project should now look like this:

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
    └── src
        ├── main
        │  └── java
        │  └── resources
        │  └── webapp
        │  └── liberty
        │         └── config
        └── test
            └── java
----

Now, run the following command:

[role='command']
```
mvn install
```

This command will rebuild the application, including the test you've added, run the test, 
and see that the test passes. The Maven build takes a little longer than before the test 
existed, but expect to see the following information in the output:

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
-------------------------------------------------------
 T E S T S
-------------------------------------------------------
Running io.openliberty.guides.hello.it.EndpointIT
Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.255 sec - in io.openliberty.guides.hello.it.EndpointIT

Results :

Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
----

To see whether the test detects a failure, change the response string in the servlet 
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/hello/HelloServlet.java` so that it doesn't match 
the string that the test is looking for. Then re-run the Maven build and check that the 
test fails.

== Great work! You're done!

You built and tested a web application project with an Open Liberty server using Maven.

You can quickly create this project structure by using the https://liberty-app-accelerator.wasdev.developer.ibm.com/start/[Liberty App Accelerator] accelerator or the Maven https://github.com/WASdev/ci.maven#liberty-archetype-webapp[liberty-archetype-webapp] archetype.
